# Starport

Starport is the easiest way to build blockchains. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmbPjCGDXek

## Install

### NPM

```
npm i -g @tendermint/starport
```

### macOS with Homebrew

```
brew install tendermint/tap/starport
```

### Build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/starport && cd starport && make
```

Requirements: Go 1.14 and Node.js (optional but highly recommended, used for the welcome screen and web app scaffolding).

## Get started

### Create an application

This command creates an empty template for a Cosmos SDK application. By default it also includes a module with the same name as the package. To create a new application called `blog`, run:

```
starport app github.com/your-github-id/blog
```

### Run an application

```
starport serve
```

To start the server, go into you application's directory and run `starport serve`. This commands installs dependencies, builds and initializes the app and runs both Tendermint RPC server (by default on `localhost:26657`) as well as LCD (by default on `localhost:1317`) with hot reloading enabled.

Note: depending on your OS and firewall settings, you may have to accept a prompt asking if your application's binary (`blogd` in this case) can accept external connections.

### Create data types

```
starport type [typeName] [field1] [field2:bool] ...
```

This command generates messages, handlers, keepers, CLI and REST clients and type definition for `typeName` type. A type can have any number of `field` arguments. By default fields are strings, but `bool` and `int` are supported.

For example,

```
starport type post title body
```

This command generates a type `Post` with two fields: `title` and `body`.

To add a post run `blogcli tx blog create-post "My title" "This is a blog" --from=user1`.

### Add smart contract support

```
starport add wasm
```

Adds smart contracts with [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com). Follow a short [smart contract tutorial](https://www.notion.so/Smart-contracts-with-CosmWasm-c6fbcd584b78437a843e738b922dc108) to get started.
