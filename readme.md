# Introduction

Starport is the easiest way to build blockchains. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic. [Watch the overview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmbPjCGDXek)
