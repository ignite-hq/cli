# Starport

Starport is the easiest way to build blockchains. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

## Install

### In browser

➡️ Check out <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/" target="_blank">Starport in browser-based IDE</a>. Fastest way to get started! `starport` binary is already installed, just create an application and start hacking!

### NPM

```
npm i -g @tendermint/starport
```

### macOS with Homebrew

```
brew install tendermint/tap/starport
```

### Debian/Ubuntu with Snapcraft

```
snap install --classic node
```

Append your current working directory to the environment variable `PATH`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node_modules/.bin/
```

### Build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/starport && cd starport && make
```

Requirements: Go 1.14 and Node.js (optional but highly recommended, used for the welcome screen and web app scaffolding).

## Get started

### Create a blockchain

The `app` command creates a template for a Cosmos SDK blockchain. By default it also includes a module with the same name as the package. To create a new application called `mychain`, run:

```
starport app github.com/foo/mychain
```

### Run your blockchain

To start the server, go into you blockain's directory and run the `serve` command:

```
starport serve
```

This commands installs dependencies, builds, initializes and runs the blockchain with live-reloading enabled. Learn more about [creating](docs/02%20Using%20Starport/01_using_starport/01_using_starport.md#your-blockchain-application) and [running](docs/02%20Using%20Starport/01_using_starport/01_using_starport.md#serve) applications with Starport in the docs.
