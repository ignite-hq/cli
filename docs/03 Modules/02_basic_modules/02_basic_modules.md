# Cosmos SDK Basic Modules

When creating a blockchain with starport or manually with the Cosmos SDK, there is a set of modules that you should be using in order to have a set of rules that define a blockchain in the first place.
These modules are 

- [auth](#auth)
- [bank](#bank)
- [staking](#staking)
- [distribution](#distribution)
- [params](#params)

## Auth

The `auth` module is responsible for accounts on the blockchain and basic transaction types that accounts can use. 

It introduces Gas and Fees as concepts in order to prevent the blockchain to bloat by not-identifyable accounts, as on public blockchains you do not have more information about accounts as the public key or balance of an account or the previous transaction history. 

The interface of an Account is defined as

```go
type BaseAccount struct {
  Address       AccAddress
  Coins         Coins
  PubKey        PubKey
  AccountNumber uint64
  Sequence      uint64
}
```

The `auth` module exposes the account keeper where accounts can be stored or changed. Furthermore it exposes the types for Standard transactions, fees, signatures or replay-prevention. It also allows for vesting accounts, as that certain coins can be made accessible over a period of time to an entity. The vesting logic is mostly used for unbonding of staking but can also be used for other purposes.

## Bank

The `bank` module has its name because it acts as the module that allows for token transfers and checks for the validity of each transfer. Furthermore, it is responsible for checking the whole supply of the chain, the sum of all account balances.

## Staking

The `staking` module allows for an advanced Proof of Stake system, where validators can be created and tokens delegated to validators.

## Distribution

The `distribution` module is responsible to distribute the inflation of a Token. When new Tokens get created, they get distributed to the validators and their respective delegators, with a potential commission the validator takes. Each validator can choose a commission of those Token when creating a validator, this commission is editable.

## Params

The `params` module allows for a global parameter store in your blockchain application. It is designed to hold the chain parameters so that they can be changed during runtime by governance. It allows to upgrade the blockchain parameters via the `government` module and take effect on an agreed upon time when the majority of the shareholders decide to make a change.

Those modules are typically installed on default when using starport. There are a range of modules that are also part of the Cosmos SDK, additionally some other public modules have already reached a major level of usage and acceptance. We will look at more advanced modules in the next Chapter.

## Summary

- The basic modules form the foundation of a Cosmos SDK blockchain.
- The modules allow for account management, sending Tokens, managing supply and blockchain access.
- Modules are "plug-and-play" for the Cosmos SDK.
