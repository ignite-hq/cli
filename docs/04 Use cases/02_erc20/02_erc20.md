# ERC20

Starport and the Cosmos SDK support to create more than just one token on your blockchain, by specifying this with starport in your `config.yml` or in general in your `genesis.json` file. These tokens can only be manipulated by approval of the validators that run the blockchain. In case you want entities using your blockchain to be able to create their own tokens, the ERC20 Standard is a great fit.
We have several choices how to execute smart contracts with the Cosmos SDK. In the following chapters we will explore how to use the ERC20 standard on Ethermint with Solidity and on CosmWasm with Rust.

## Smart Contracts on Cosmos

In order to understand more details about smart contracts, it makes sense to look at the most popular and used smart contract, the ERC20 (and following ERC777). The ERC20 contract is the standard on the EVM to allow users to create their own token on a smart contract basis. This token is usually finite in supply, have fixed decimal places and are transferable on the blockchain it is uploaded on. 
Therefore the most important functions an ERC20 uses are

- `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)`
```solidity
uint8 public decimals;                //How many decimals to show.
```

- `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
```solidity
function EIP20(
    uint256 _initialAmount,
    string _tokenName,
    uint8 _decimalUnits,
    string _tokenSymbol
) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = _initialAmount;               // Give the creator all initial tokens
    totalSupply = _initialAmount;                        // Update total supply
    name = _tokenName;                                   // Set the name for display purposes
    decimals = _decimalUnits;                            // Amount of decimals for display purposes
    symbol = _tokenSymbol;                               // Set the symbol for display purposes
}
```

- `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); //solhint-disable-line indent, no-unused-vars
    return true;
}
```

To make it work in production we still need a few other functions and more code for edgecases. The whole contract for the ERC20 can be read on [Consensys ERC20](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/fdf687c69d998266a95f15216b1955a4965a0a6d/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol) or [OpenZeppelin ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/9b3710465583284b8c4c5d2245749246bb2e0094/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) and the specification is available under https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20.

If you are desired to learn more about smart contracts, understanding the ERC20 specification and code gives an important insight, as the code is short and clear. It probably is the most battle-tested smart contract with dozens of implementations and millions of transactions that have used it. ERC20 on the EVM has a few edgecases that have been overcome by ERC777 - which adds important usability functions to the ERC20.
You can research which functions are added and why by [Dexaran](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/erc20-token-standard-critical-problems-3c10fd48657b).

## ERC20 on Ethermint

Ethermint is the Cosmos SDK module that allows to replicate the EVM. We can load solidity contracts onto the Cosmos SDK blockchain. Let us examine an example usage of Ethermint with the ERC20 Token.

Working with Ethermint can come in different forms. You can either work with the official [Ethermint chain](https://ethermint.zone/), fork from the [Ethermint Codebase](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ethermint) or use the EVM Module in your own Cosmos SDK application. The last option is what we will be looking into. We have created our Cosmos SDK template with Starport and we can just add the Ethereum Virtual Machine to our application and allow smart contracts to be created in Solity and uploaded to the blockchain.

[Read how to integrate the `evm` module into your Cosmos SDK application.](05_extras/05_01_cosmos_entermint/05_01_cosmos_ethermint.md)

## Creating our environment

First, we start the blockchain with

```
starport serve --verbose
````

The `--verbose` flag is helpful in development and will show us if there are any errors in launching our blockchain application. From here we create our keys and fund them from the initial account that we created in the genesis block

```
# this will create keys and display the private, public key and cosmos address
ethappcli keys add mykey
# Now we can fund the given 'address'
ethappcli tx send user1 cosmosxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "100000token"
```

Query for your account and balances to confirm the tranasction

```bash
ethappcli q auth account $(ethappcli keys show mykey -a) -o text
```

Launch the Rest API Server with the newly created key
```bash
ethappcli rest-server --laddr "tcp://localhost:8545"  --chain-id "123" --trace --unlock-key=mykey
```

## Uploading a contract

With having the `evm` module available we now can upload contracts with the `create` command. First, we have to compile our contract into bytecode. We will choose the [ERC777 contract from OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc777) as an exercise. It is the upgrade of the ERC20 and allows for Fungible Token creation and transfer.

For this, we will fork the code from [OpenZeppelin ERC777 GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol) and compile it to bytecode.

In order to compile a smart contract to bytecode, we will be using Truffle.

Truffle allows us to work with a contract and compile it.

- [Install Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)

```bash
npm install -g truffle
# And adding file flattener
npm install -g truffle-flattener
```

First, let us setup our contract working repository 

```bash
mkdir erc777 && cd erc777
truffle init
```

From here, we move into the `erc777/contracts` folder, we delete the available example `Counter.sol` and create our own `token.sol` contract file. We use the following code to mint a new ERC777 transaction that has a name that we can define.
For demonstration purposes we name it `PrintedTokenName` and give it the abbreviation `XRP` and mint `10000` Token with 18 decimal places (as usual on ETH).

```
//token.sol

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol";


/**
 * @title Simple777Token
 * @dev Very simple ERC777 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.
 * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other
 * `ERC20` or `ERC777` functions.
 * Based on https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/examples/SimpleToken.sol
 */
contract Simple777Token is ERC777 {

    /**
     * @dev Constructor that gives msg.sender all of existing tokens.
     */
    constructor () public ERC777("PrintedTokenName", "XRP", new address[](0)) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 10000 * 10 ** 18, "", "");
    }
}
```

We can compile the code to a single file with

```bash
truffle-flattener contracts/erc777.sol > erc777_production.sol
```

## Deployment

We have compiled our contract. Now we need to upload it to the blockchain.

Useful commands for deployment

Start rest server
```bash
ethappcli rest-server --rpc --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcapi "db,eth,web3,personal,admin,txpool"
```

Migrate with truffle
```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```
