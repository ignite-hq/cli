# Documents and Specification

This series of tutorials help you get started with creating blockchains and build example usecases. Once you are more familiar with Starport, Tendermint Consensus and the Cosmos SDK, you will need other resources.
That is where the documentation and the Specification will give you exact knowledge on each of the topics.

## Documentation

The most up-to-date documentation is the code itself, with comments and readme files. You can find more about the Tendermint Consensus on https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint and get to know more about the BFT consensus mechanisms.

The CosmosSDK with its modules can be found on https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk aswell as more tutorials and resources on https://docs.cosmos.network/.

Starport is being hosted on https://github.com/tendermint/starport and more documentation can be found in the folder https://github.com/tendermint/starport/tree/develop/docs.

## Specification 

More formal specification of Tendermint can be found on https://github.com/tendermint/spec/tree/master/spec and can guide you along Data Structures, Consensus Protocol, P2P and Network Protocols and the Software.

For the Cosmos SDK the specification explain more details about the Storage on the blockchain, Bech32 address information as well as Module specification and can be found on https://docs.cosmos.network/master/spec/.
