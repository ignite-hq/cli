title: v0.26.0
description: For chains that were scaffolded with Ignite CLI versions lower than v0.26.0. changes are required to use Ignite CLI v0.26.0.
---

Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` is fully compatible with chains that are compatible with `v0.25.1`.  Please follow the existing
migration guides if your chain is not upgraded to `v0.25.1` support.

### Go Version

Chains that are newly scaffolded with Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` now require `go 1.19` in their `go.mod` files.  It is 
recommended that chains scaffolded with an older version of Ignite CLI also bump their required `go` version and update 
their tooling to the latest version.

### Scaffolded Release Workflow

The develop branch of the CLI has been deprecated. To continue using the release workflow that uses the CLI to 
automatically build and release your chain's binaries, replace develop with main in the following lines:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/release.yml
...

jobs:
  might_release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Prepare Release Variables 
        id: vars
        // highlight-next-line
        uses: ignite/cli/actions/release/vars@main
      - name: Issue Release Assets
        // highlight-next-line
        uses: ignite/cli/actions/cli@main
        if: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.should_release == 'true' }}
        with:
          args: chain build --release --release.prefix ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tarball_prefix }} -t linux:amd64 -t darwin:amd64 -t darwin:arm64
      - name: Delete the "latest" Release
        uses: dev-drprasad/delete-tag-and-release@v0.2.0
        if: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.is_release_type_latest == 'true' }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}
          delete_release: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Publish the Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.should_release == 'true' }}
        with:

          files: release/*
