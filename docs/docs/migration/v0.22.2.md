# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.22.2

Ignite CLI v0.22.2 changed the GitHub username from "ignite-hq" to "ignite", which means the imports must be fixed to reflect this change.

1. In your `go.mod` file find the require line for Ignite CLI that starts with `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` and is followed by a version.
   It looks something like `github.com/ignite-hq/cli v0.22.0`, and replace it by `github.com/ignite/cli v0.22.2`.

2. Open the `app/app.go` file and replace the import line `github.com/ignite-hq/cli/ignite/pkg/openapiconsole` by `github.com/ignite/cli/ignite/pkg/openapiconsole`.

3. Open the following files and replace the import line `github.com/ignite-hq/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmoscmd` by `github.com/ignite/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmoscmd`:

 - `app/app.go`
 - `app/simulation_test.go`
 - `testutil/network/network.go`

4. Open the `main.go` file located in the sub-folder inside the app's `cmd/` directory and replace the import line `github.com/ignite-hq/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmoscmd`
   by `github.com/ignite/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmoscmd`.

5. If you imported a package from Ignite CLI after scaffolding make sure to change those import URL starting with the prefix `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` to start
   with the prefix `github.com/ignite/cli` instead.

6. Finally run `go mod tidy` where your app's `go.sum` file is located.
