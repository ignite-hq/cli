# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.22.2

Ignite CLI v0.22.2 changed the GitHub username from "ignite-hq" to "ignite".

1. Open your `go.mod` and change the Ignite CLI line with `github.com/ignite/cli v0.22.2`

2. In your `go.sum` file change `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` to `github.com/ignite/cli`

3. Make sure that your all CLI import lines in yout app start with `github.com/ignite/cli`, including these files:

 - `app/app.go`
 - `app/simulation_test.go`
 - `testutil/network/network.go`

4. Finally open the `main.go` file located inside the app's `cmd/` directory and also make sure the cosmoscmd package is imported as `github.com/ignite/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmoscmd`
