title: v0.26.0
description: For chains that were scaffolded with Ignite CLI versions lower than v0.26.0. changes are required to use Ignite CLI v0.26.0.
---

Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` is fully compatible with chains that are compatible with `v0.25.1`.  Please follow the existing
migration guides if your chain is not upgraded to `v0.25.1` support.

## Go Version

Chains that are newly scaffolded with Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` now require `go 1.19` in their `go.mod` files.  It is 
recommended that chains scaffolded with an older version of Ignite CLI also bump their required `go` version and update 
their tooling to the latest version.

## ibc-go v6

Chains that are newly scaffolded with Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` now use `ibc-go/v6` for ibc functionality.  It is not 
necessary, but recommended to upgrade to the newest version of `ibc-go`.  Most migrations can be done by following the 
`ibc-go` [migration guide](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/docs/migrations/v5-to-v6.md), but there are some 
specific changes that will need to be followed for Ignite scaffolded chains.

### Removing `cosmosibckeeper`

Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` has deprecated [pkg/cosmosibckeeper](https://github.com/ignite/cli/tree/main/ignite/pkg/cosmosibckeeper).
This package contained interfaces for ibc-related keepers.  Newly scaffolded chains now include the interface files in their
`./x/{moduleName}/types` directory in a new `expected_ibc_keeper.go` file. To migrate, create the following file for
each module:

```go title="x/{moduleName}/types/expected_ibc_keeper.go"
package types

import (
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
	capabilitytypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/capability/types"
	clienttypes "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/core/02-client/types"
	channeltypes "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/core/04-channel/types"
)

// ChannelKeeper defines the expected IBC channel keeper.
type ChannelKeeper interface {
	GetChannel(ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string) (channeltypes.Channel, bool)
	GetNextSequenceSend(ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string) (uint64, bool)
	SendPacket(
		ctx sdk.Context,
		channelCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
		sourcePort string,
		sourceChannel string,
		timeoutHeight clienttypes.Height,
		timeoutTimestamp uint64,
		data []byte,
	) (uint64, error)
	ChanCloseInit(ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability) error
}

// PortKeeper defines the expected IBC port keeper.
type PortKeeper interface {
	BindPort(ctx sdk.Context, portID string) *capabilitytypes.Capability
}

// ScopedKeeper defines the expected IBC scoped keeper.
type ScopedKeeper interface {
	GetCapability(ctx sdk.Context, name string) (*capabilitytypes.Capability, bool)
	AuthenticateCapability(ctx sdk.Context, cap *capabilitytypes.Capability, name string) bool
	ClaimCapability(ctx sdk.Context, cap *capabilitytypes.Capability, name string) error
}
```

Next, make the following updates to each `x/{moduleName}/keeper/keeper.go` file for each ibc-enabled
module in your project:

```go title="x/{moduleName}/keeper/keeper.go"
package keeper

import (
	"fmt"

	"blogibc/x/testibc/types"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
	storetypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/store/types"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
	paramtypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/params/types"
	"github.com/ignite/cli/ignite/pkg/cosmosibckeeper"
	"github.com/tendermint/tendermint/libs/log"
)

type (
	Keeper struct {
		*cosmosibckeeper.Keeper
		cdc        codec.BinaryCodec
		storeKey   storetypes.StoreKey
		memKey     storetypes.StoreKey
		paramstore paramtypes.Subspace
	}
)

func NewKeeper(
	cdc codec.BinaryCodec,
	storeKey,
	memKey storetypes.StoreKey,
	ps paramtypes.Subspace,
	channelKeeper cosmosibckeeper.ChannelKeeper,
	portKeeper cosmosibckeeper.PortKeeper,
	scopedKeeper cosmosibckeeper.ScopedKeeper,

) *Keeper {
	// set KeyTable if it has not already been set
	if !ps.HasKeyTable() {
		ps = ps.WithKeyTable(types.ParamKeyTable())
	}

	return &Keeper{
		Keeper: cosmosibckeeper.NewKeeper(
			types.PortKey,
			storeKey,
			channelKeeper,
			portKeeper,
			scopedKeeper,
		),
		cdc:        cdc,
		storeKey:   storeKey,
		memKey:     memKey,
		paramstore: ps,
	}
}

func (k Keeper) Logger(ctx sdk.Context) log.Logger {
	return ctx.Logger().With("module", fmt.Sprintf("x/%s", types.ModuleName))
}
```
