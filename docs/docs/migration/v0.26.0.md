title: v0.26.0
description: For chains that were scaffolded with Ignite CLI versions lower than v0.26.0. changes are required to use Ignite CLI v0.26.0.
---

Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` is fully compatible with chains that are compatible with `v0.25.1`.  Please follow the existing
migration guides if your chain is not upgraded to `v0.25.1` support.

### Go Version

Chains that are newly scaffolded with Ignite CLI `v0.26.0` now require `go 1.19` in their `go.mod` files.  It is 
recommended that chains scaffolded with an older version of Ignite CLI also bump their required `go` version and update 
their tooling to the latest version.
